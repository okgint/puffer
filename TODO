TODO for v1.1
Change DiscriminatorHelper.getPacketLength(Class<? extends AbstractPacket>) to accommodate variable length fields based on the message
Add feature to have a field hold a length of another field. Already implemented for Lists, need it for simple types.
Replace java util logging with SLF4J

TODO v1.2
Allow mapping without extending AbstractPacket

TODO v1.3
Allow support for Maps (key value pairs) instead of forcing the user to create a List<Pair>
